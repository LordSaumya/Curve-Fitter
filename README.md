# Curve-Fitter
Python Code that fits selected function to data
It takes data as input, and asks you which function you wish to fit on the data (sine wave, linear, quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, exponential). 
Then, it optimises the function and generates a function that best fits the data along with the derivative of the function, the random mean squared 
error, and the coefficient of determination. It also graphs the data and the optimised function.
